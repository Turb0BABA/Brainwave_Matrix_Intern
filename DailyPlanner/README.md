Getting Started
To run this project locally, simply follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the project files (index.html, style.css, script.js).

Open the index.html file in your favorite web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

That's it! The application is fully self-contained and requires no build steps or dependencies.

Technologies Used
This project was built from the ground up using core web technologies:

HTML5: For the structure and content of the application.

CSS3: For all styling, including Flexbox, Grid, custom variables for theming, and responsive design.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all application logic, state management, DOM manipulation, and interactivity.

How It Works
State Management: The application state (all tasks, subtasks, and dates) is managed in a single JavaScript object and saved to localStorage.

Timezone-Safe Dates: A custom date formatting function ensures that tasks always appear on the correct date, regardless of the user's local timezone.

Dynamic Rendering: The UI is dynamically rendered based on the current state, ensuring that any change (like adding a task or changing the theme) is immediately reflected on the screen.
